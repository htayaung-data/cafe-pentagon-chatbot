# Human Assistance Flagging Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve issues with human assistance flagging in the Cafe Pentagon Chatbot. The main problems were:

1. **Human assistance flags not being set** when users request human help
2. **Facebook Messenger not responding** to messages
3. **Missing integration** between LangGraph workflow and conversation tracking

## Issues Identified

### 1. Human Assistance Detection Not Working

**Problem**: When users asked for human assistance (e.g., "I need to talk to a human", "လူသားနဲ့ပြောချင်ပါတယ်"), the system was not properly setting the `human_handling` and `requires_human` flags.

**Root Cause**: The response generator node was not detecting human assistance requests and the conversation tracking service was not properly handling these flags.

### 2. Facebook Messenger Not Responding

**Problem**: Facebook Messenger webhook was receiving messages but not generating responses.

**Root Cause**: The LangGraph workflow integration was incomplete and human assistance detection was not working properly.

### 3. Missing Database Integration

**Problem**: Even when human assistance was detected, the flags were not being saved to the Supabase database.

**Root Cause**: The conversation tracking service was not properly integrated with the LangGraph workflow.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Response Generator Node

**File**: `src/graph/nodes/response_generator.py`

**Changes**:
- Added `_detect_human_assistance_request()` method to detect human assistance requests
- Enhanced pattern matching for both English and Burmese
- Updated state management to properly set `human_handling` and `requires_human` flags
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

**Key Features**:
```python
def _detect_human_assistance_request(self, user_message: str, language: str) -> bool:
    # English patterns
    english_patterns = [
        "talk to a human", "speak to someone", "talk to someone",
        "human help", "real person", "staff member", "employee",
        "manager", "supervisor", "customer service",
        "i need help", "can't help", "not working",
        "complaint", "problem", "issue", "escalate"
    ]
    
    # Burmese patterns
    burmese_patterns = [
        "လူသားနဲ့ပြောချင်ပါတယ်", "အကူအညီလိုပါတယ်",
        "ပိုကောင်းတဲ့အကူအညီလိုပါတယ်", "သူငယ်ချင်းနဲ့ပြောချင်ပါတယ်",
        "လူသားနဲ့ပြောချင်တယ်", "အကူအညီလိုတယ်",
        "မန်နေဂျာ", "အုပ်ချုပ်သူ", "ဝန်ထမ်း",
        "ပြဿနာ", "အခက်အခဲ", "အကူအညီလိုပါတယ်"
    ]
```

### 2. Enhanced Conversation Tracking Service

**File**: `src/services/conversation_tracking_service.py`

**Changes**:
- Added `_check_content_for_human_assistance()` method to detect human assistance in message content
- Enhanced `save_message()` to automatically detect and flag human assistance requests
- Added `_update_conversation_for_human_assistance()` method to update conversation status
- Improved logging and error handling

**Key Features**:
```python
def _check_content_for_human_assistance(self, content: str) -> bool:
    # Automatically detects human assistance keywords in message content
    # Updates conversation status when human assistance is detected
    # Sets proper flags in both messages and conversations tables
```

### 3. Fixed Facebook Messenger Integration

**File**: `src/services/facebook_messenger.py`

**Changes**:
- Fixed LangGraph workflow integration with proper compilation
- Added human assistance flag extraction from final state
- Enhanced conversation tracking integration
- Improved error handling and logging

**Key Features**:
```python
# Run the conversation graph
compiled_workflow = self.conversation_graph.compile()
final_state = await compiled_workflow.ainvoke(initial_state)

# Extract human assistance flags
response = {
    "human_handling": final_state.get("human_handling", False),
    "requires_human": final_state.get("requires_human", False)
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Conversation Memory Updater

**File**: `src/graph/nodes/conversation_memory_updater.py`

**Changes**:
- Added human assistance flag handling in conversation memory
- Enhanced conversation tracking service integration
- Improved metadata management for human assistance requests

### 5. Comprehensive Testing Suite

**File**: `test_human_assistance.py`

**Features**:
- Tests both Streamlit and Facebook Messenger integration
- Validates human assistance detection for English and Burmese
- Tests conversation tracking service functionality
- Comprehensive logging and error reporting

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Run the Test Suite

```bash
python test_human_assistance.py
```

This will test:
- Human assistance detection in Streamlit
- Human assistance detection in Facebook Messenger
- Conversation tracking service functionality
- Database integration

### 2. Test Streamlit Interface

1. Start the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Test human assistance requests:
   - English: "I need to talk to a human"
   - Burmese: "လူသားနဲ့ပြောချင်ပါတယ်"
   - English: "Can I speak to someone?"
   - Burmese: "အကူအညီလိုပါတယ်"

3. Check the metadata panel to verify flags are set:
   - `human_handling` should be `True`
   - `requires_human` should be `True`

### 3. Test Facebook Messenger

1. Start the API server:
```bash
python api.py
```

2. Send messages to your Facebook page:
   - "I need to talk to a human"
   - "လူသားနဲ့ပြောချင်ပါတယ်"
   - "Can I speak to someone?"

3. Verify responses are generated and human assistance flags are set

### 4. Check Database

1. Check the `conversations` table:
```sql
SELECT id, user_id, human_handling, rag_enabled, status 
FROM conversations 
WHERE human_handling = true 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

2. Check the `messages` table:
```sql
SELECT id, conversation_id, content, requires_human, human_replied 
FROM messages 
WHERE requires_human = true 
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

## Expected Behavior

### When Human Assistance is Requested:

1. **Response Generation**: The bot should respond with an escalation message
2. **Flag Setting**: Both `human_handling` and `requires_human` should be set to `True`
3. **Database Updates**: 
   - `conversations.human_handling` = `true`
   - `conversations.rag_enabled` = `false`
   - `conversations.status` = `"escalated"`
   - `messages.requires_human` = `true`
4. **Admin Panel**: The conversation should appear in the admin panel as requiring human attention

### When Normal Queries are Made:

1. **Response Generation**: The bot should respond normally with RAG-enabled responses
2. **Flag Setting**: Both `human_handling` and `requires_human` should be `False`
3. **Database Updates**: Normal conversation flow with RAG enabled

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Flags not being set**: Check if the LangGraph workflow is properly compiled and executed
2. **Database not updated**: Verify Supabase connection and permissions
3. **Facebook Messenger not responding**: Check webhook configuration and API endpoints
4. **Test failures**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and environment variables are set

### Debug Steps:

1. Check logs for human assistance detection:
```bash
grep "human_assistance_request_detected" logs/app.log
```

2. Verify conversation tracking:
```bash
grep "conversation_updated_for_human_assistance" logs/app.log
```

3. Check Facebook Messenger processing:
```bash
grep "message_processed" logs/app.log
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables:

Ensure these are properly set:
```bash
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
FACEBOOK_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_facebook_token
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

### Database Schema:

Ensure your Supabase database has the required columns:
- `conversations.human_handling` (boolean)
- `conversations.rag_enabled` (boolean)
- `messages.requires_human` (boolean)
- `messages.human_replied` (boolean)

## Summary

These fixes ensure that:

1. ✅ Human assistance requests are properly detected in both English and Burmese
2. ✅ Human assistance flags are correctly set in the LangGraph workflow
3. ✅ Database is properly updated with human assistance status
4. ✅ Facebook Messenger integration works correctly
5. ✅ Admin panel can properly display conversations requiring human attention
6. ✅ Comprehensive testing validates all functionality

The system now properly handles the complete human assistance workflow from detection to escalation to admin notification.
