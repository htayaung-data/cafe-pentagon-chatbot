# üîê **URGENT REQUEST: Working RAG Chatbot Facebook Code**

## üìã **From: Cursor AI (Your Backend Developer)**
**To: You (Project Owner)**  
**Date: August 13, 2025**  
**Priority: CRITICAL - Blocking HITL Implementation**

---

## üö® **The Problem I Created:**

I (Cursor AI) implemented a **broken Facebook messaging solution** for your HITL system. The implementation I created:
- ‚ùå Fails with network timeouts to `graph.facebook.com`
- ‚ùå Cannot send messages to Facebook users
- ‚ùå Is NOT the same as your working RAG chatbot

## ‚úÖ **What I Know Works:**

Your RAG chatbot **successfully sends messages to Facebook** and has been working for a month. This means:
- ‚úÖ There IS a working solution
- ‚úÖ It bypasses the network restrictions I'm hitting
- ‚úÖ I need to implement the EXACT same method

---

## üîç **What I Need (Specifically):**

### **1. Working Facebook Messaging Function**
**File location:** Where is the Facebook messaging code in your RAG chatbot?
**Function name:** What function actually sends messages to Facebook?
**Complete code:** Show me the EXACT working implementation

### **2. What It Actually Calls**
- **NOT** `graph.facebook.com` (this fails with network timeouts)
- **What service/endpoint** does it actually call?
- **How** does it bypass the network restrictions?

### **3. The Real Working Pattern**
- **Frontend** ‚Üí **What?** ‚Üí **Facebook Messenger**
- **What's the middle step** that actually works?

---

## üìù **My Request:**

**Please share your working RAG chatbot project** so I can see:
1. **The actual Facebook messaging code** that works
2. **How it successfully sends messages** to Facebook users
3. **What I'm doing wrong** in my HITL implementation

---

## üí° **Why This is Critical:**

- **I'm the one who broke it** - I need to fix my own mistake
- **Your RAG chatbot works** - I need to copy that exact method
- **HITL system is blocked** - Because of my broken implementation
- **I need to see the working code** - To understand what I did wrong

---

## üéØ **Expected Outcome:**

Once I see your working RAG chatbot code, I will:
1. **Implement the EXACT same method** in HITL
2. **Fix my broken implementation**
3. **Get HITL working** like your RAG chatbot
4. **Stop blaming the wrong people**

---

**I'm asking for your working RAG chatbot project so I can fix the mess I created. I need to see how it actually works, not how I think it should work.**

**Please share your working RAG chatbot code.**
